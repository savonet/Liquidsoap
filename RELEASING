- How to release liquidsoap -
-----------------------------

 [] Run the CI. This should run the tests and prepare all the assets.
 [] Update the versioned dependencies in `liquidsoap.opam`, release
    pending dependent bindings (see below on how to publish to `opam`).
 [] Update copyright years in headers and check that all files have license
     headers.
 [] Fill-in CHANGES, with the release date.

Opam packages
-------------

Packages can be published to opam using `opam publish`. Make sure to check upstream
for improvement made on the package files before sending the updates. `opam`
versioning for version suffix is: `x.y.z~suffix`. It is not compatible with
liquidsoap's `configure` based version detection so make sure to avoid depending
on version-suffixed packages.
