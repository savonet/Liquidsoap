Installing Liquidsoap
=============================

**Note** These instructions are from the documentation from liquidsoap `@LIQUIDSOAP_VERSION@`.
Make sure to consult the instructions from the version you wish to install,
most likely the latest stable release.

You can install liquidsoap using binary builds, with OPAM or from source.

Binary builds are provided with our releases, either in the form or debian/ubuntu and alpine
packages or as docker images (also for debian or alpine). Your favorite distribution may also have
binary packages.

The binary package and docker images we provide are compiled in two flavors:
* The main `liquidsoap` packages are compile with all available features and functions. This is a good starting point for general-purpose development
* Binary packages and docker images labelled `-minimal` are compiled without the `extra` libraries and with a limited set of essential optional features

Minimal builds are useful if you are concerned about size or memory usage. They also reduce the chances of running into issues that could be introduced
by optional dependencies that you do not use. If your script works with them, they are recommended over the fully featured builds for production.

Each binary build that we provide have a corresponding `*.config` file. This is a text file that lists all the features included in a specific
binary build. You can consult it to know that features are available. You can also get the same information by calling `liquidsoap --build-config`, for instance
when using a docker image.

Binary packages and docker images are useful in that they provide a readily available liquidsoap installation. If you
need more finer-grained build or if your distribution/OS does not have a binary build, you can
install via OPAM, which is a very convenient package manager that can compile liquidsoap from sources
and knows how to handle external dependencies for most OS/distributions.

Lastly, compiling from source should be reserved to developers.

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

We generate debian and ubuntu packages automatically as part of our [release process](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases). Otherwise, you
can check out the official [debian](https://packages.debian.org/liquidsoap) and [ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/liquidsoap) packages.

Alpine
------

Alpine packages are also provided as part of our [release process](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases).

Docker
------

We provide production-ready docker images via [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/savonet/liquidsoap).
Docker images are tagged with a release tag (e.g. `v2.1.4`) and with the sha of their git commit (e.g. `a24bf49`). Please note
that images tagged with a release tag may change while images tagged with a commit sha will not.

Windows
-------

You can download a liquidsoap for windows from our [release page](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases).

Install using OPAM
------------------

The recommended method to install liquidsoap frim source is by using the [OCaml Package
Manager](http://opam.ocaml.org/). OPAM is available in all major distributions
and on windows. We actively support the liquidsoap packages there and its
dependencies. You can read [here](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) about
how to use OPAM. In order to use it:

- [you should have at least OPAM version 2.1](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html),
- you should have at least OCaml version @min_ocaml_version@, which can be achieved by typing
  ```
  opam switch create @min_ocaml_version@
  ```

A typical installation with most expected features is done by executing:

```
opam depext taglib mad lame ffmpeg liquidsoap
opam install taglib mad lame ffmpeg liquidsoap
```

* `opam depext ...` takes care of installing the required external
  dependencies. In some cases external dependencies might be missing for your
  system. If that is the case, please report it to us!
* Finally `opam install ...` installs the packages themselves.

Most of liquidsoap's dependencies are only optionally installed by OPAM. For
instance, if you want to enable opus encoding and decoding after you've already
installed liquidsoap, you should execute the following:

```
opam depext opus
opam install opus
```

`opam info liquidsoap` should give you the list of all optional dependencies
that you may enable in liquidsoap.

Installing from source
