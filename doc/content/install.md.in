Installing Liquidsoap
=============================

**Note** These instructions are from the documentation from liquidsoap `@LIQUIDSOAP_VERSION@`.
Make sure to consult the instructions from the version you wish to install,
most likely the latest stable release.

You can install liquidsoap using binary builds, with OPAM or from source.

Binary builds are provided with our releases, either in the form or debian/ubuntu and alpine
packages or as docker images (also for debian or alpine). Your favorite distribution may also have
binary packages.

Binary packages are useful in that they provide a readily available liquidsoap installation. If you
need more finer-grained build or if your distribution/OS does not have a binary build, you can
install via OPAM, which is a very convenient package manager that can compile liquidsoap from sources
and knows how to handle external dependencies for most OS/distributions.

Lastly, compiling from source should be reserved to developers.

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

We generate debian and ubuntu packages automatically as part of our CI workflow.
Starting with release [1.4.3](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases),
we provide them along with the release. Otherwise, you can visit our
[github actions](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/actions) to fetch individual
ones.

Docker
------

We provide production-ready docker images via [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/savonet/liquidsoap).
These images contain a minimal `debian/testing` image with the liquidsoap debian package installed.
Installed packages are those generated during our CI process, not the official debian package! Images are tagged
by the branch that was used to generate them.

Windows
-------

You can download a liquidsoap for windows from our [release
page](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases), starting with version
`1.3.4`.

Liquidsoap for windows is built using [opam-cross](https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-windows). The build process is documented in  our [docker files](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-full/tree/master/docker). `Dockerfile.win32-deps` installs all  the [mxe](https://mxe.cc/) dependencies and `Dockerfile.win32` produces the actual liquidsoap binary.

You might want to refer to each project, [mxe](https://mxe.cc/) and [opam-cross](https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-windows) for more details about cross-compiling for windows.

Install using OPAM
------------------

The recommended method to install liquidsoap is by using the [OCaml Package
Manager](http://opam.ocaml.org/). OPAM is available in all major distributions
and on windows. We actively support the liquidsoap packages there and its
dependencies. You can read [here](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) about
how to use OPAM. In order to use it:

- [you should have at least OPAM version 2.0](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html),
- you should have at least OCaml version @min_ocaml_version@, which can be achieved by typing
  ```
  opam switch create @min_ocaml_version@
  ```

A typical installation with most expected features is done by executing:

```
opam depext taglib mad lame ffmpeg liquidsoap
opam install taglib mad lame ffmpeg liquidsoap
```

* `opam depext ...` takes care of installing the required external
  dependencies. In some cases external dependencies might be missing for your
  system. If that is the case, please report it to us!
* Finally `opam install ...` installs the packages themselves.

Most of liquidsoap's dependencies are only optionally installed by OPAM. For
instance, if you want to enable opus encoding and decoding after you've already
installed liquidsoap, you should execute the following:

```
opam depext opus
opam install opus
```

`opam info liquidsoap` should give you the list of all optional dependencies
that you may enable in liquidsoap.

If you need to run liquidsoap as daemon, we provide a package named
`liquidsoap-daemon`.  See
[savonet/liquidsoap-daemon](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-daemon) for
more information.

You can also install liquidsoap or any of its dependencies from source using
OPAM. For instance:

```
git clone https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap.git
cd liquidsoap
opam pin add liquidsoap .
```

Most dependencies should be compatible with OPAM pinning. Let us know if you
find one that isn't.
