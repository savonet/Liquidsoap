# Run a function in a separate thread.
# @category Control
# @param ~fast Whether the thread is supposed to return quickly or not. Typically, blocking tasks (e.g. fetching data over the internet) should not be considered to be fast. When set to `false` its priority will be lowered below that of request resolutions and fast timeouts. This is only effective if you set a dedicated queue for fast tasks, see the "scheduler" settings for more details.
# @param ~delay Delay (in seconds) after which the thread should be launched.
# @param ~every How often (in seconds) the thread should be run. If negative or `null`, run once.
# @param f Function to execute.

# @category System
# @param ~every How often (in sec.) to check for the predicate.

# @param ~changed Execute the function only if the predicate was false when last checked.
# @param p Predicate indicating when to execute the function, typically a time interval such as `{10h-10h30}`.
# @param f Function to execute when the predicate is true.
