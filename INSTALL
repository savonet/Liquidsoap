Liquidsoap 1.4.0
----------------

Below is a list of dependencies, mostly OCaml libraries. Optional libraries
provide extra features. They need to be detected by the "configure" script.

Most of the libraries are developed by the Savonet project and, in addition to
being available through traditional distribution channels, are bundled in the
liquidsoap-<version>-full.tar.bz2 tarballs for easier builds.

Libraries not developed by Savonet are:

   camlimages

How to install
--------------

*BSD users, as well as OSX users might need to export some variables that can be
missing during the process:

   % export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
   % export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
   % export OCAMLMKLIB_FLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib

Also, liquidsoap needs GNU make. If you have a GNU make, this is normally
detected during configuration. If this check fails you can set the MAKE
variable:

   % export MAKE=`your make command`

The following assumes your MAKE command is make. Change to yours if different.

Now you can start the build configuration:

   % ./configure

If you want a complete installation of liquidsoap, enabling a production use of
liquidsoap as a daemon, you should pass --with-user=<login> and
--with-group=<group> options to indicate which user/group you have created for
liquidsoap.

Then, build the software:

   % make

You can also generate the documentation for liquidsoap:

   % make doc

It will generate the HTML documentation, including a version of the scripting
API reference corresponding to your configuration. If Perl's module XML::DOM is
not available it only generate a stub reference and issue a warning.

Then, you may proceed to the installation. You may need to be root for that.

   % make install

This will not install files such as /var/log/liquidsoap unless you have provided
a user/group under which liquidsoap should be ran. This behavior can be
overridden by passing INSTALL_DAEMON="yes" (useful for preparing binary
packages).

For installing developers documentation, run:

   % make api-doc-install

Then if you want services to be installed in $prefix/etc/init.d, run one of the
following. service is for a generic /bin/sh service, gentoo is for a gentoo
compliant service, to be used iff you've a gentoo linux.

   % make (service|gentoo)-install

See /doc for understanding liquidsoap scripting. Have fun!
