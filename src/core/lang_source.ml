(** An operator is a builtin function that builds a source.
  * It is registered using the wrapper [add_operator].
  * Creating the associated function type (and function) requires some work:
  *  - Specify which content_kind the source will carry:
  *    a given fixed number of channels, any fixed, a variable number?
  *  - The content_kind can also be linked to a type variable,
  *    e.g. the parameter of a format type.
  * From this high-level description a type is created. Often it will
  * carry a type constraint.
  * Once the type has been inferred, the function might be executed,
  * and at this point the type might still not be known completely
  * so we have to force its value within the acceptable range. *)
