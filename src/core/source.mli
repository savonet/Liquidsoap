  * is governed by the time it takes for the sources to produce and
  * output data.
  * In [`Auto] mode, synchronization is governed by the CPU unless at
  * least one active source is declared [self_sync] in which case latency
  * is delegated to this source. A typical example being a source linked
  * to a sound card, in which case the source latency is governed
  * by the sound card's clock. Another case is synchronous network
  * protocol such as [input.srt]. *)
