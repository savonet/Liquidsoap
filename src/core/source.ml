(** In this module we define the central streaming concepts: sources, active
    sources and clocks.

    Sources can produce a stream, if something pulls it.
    Sources can pull streams from other sources (such non-elementary sources
    are called operators). But who starts pulling?

    Some sources have a noticeable effect, for example outputs.
    Some are indirectly needed by outputs.
    Some are useless, they have no direct or indirect observable effect.
    We only want to pull data from sources that have an effect,
    thereby "animating them". Those sources are called active.

    Clocks are in charge of animating active sources.
    Each clock "owns" a number of active sources, and indirectly some
    sources owned by those active sources, and controls access to their
    streams. *)

(** Fallibility type MUST be defined BEFORE clocks.
    Otherwise the module cannot be well-typed since the list of all
    clock variables refers to active sources and hence to #stype : source_t.
    Don't mess with this, type errors will give you a hard time!
    (By the way, there's no problem of scope escaping for class type
    since those are structural, not nominal like a variant type.) *)
type source_t = [ `Fallible | `Infallible ]

(** {1 Proto clocks}

    Roughly describe what a clock is, and build a notion of clock variable
    on top of that. More concrete clock stuff is done the [Clock] module.

    Clocks play two roles:
     (1) making sure that one source belongs to only one time flow,
     (2) giving a handle on how to run a time flow.

    Most clocks are passive, i.e. they don't run anything
    directly, but may only tick when something happens to a source.
    The clock is the default, active clock:
    when started, it launches a thread which keeps ticking regularly.

    A clock needs to know all the active sources under its control,
    so it can execute them. This might seem surprising in some cases:
      cross(s)       <-- create a clock, assigns it to s
      output.file(s) <-- also assigns it to the output
    In effect, we make it equivalent to
      cross(output.file(s))
    Anyway, it'd be very strange that an output isn't animated at all.

    Clock variables can represent an unknown clock, with attached outputs.
    A source gets assigned a clock variable, which might leave it
    a chance to choose that clock (by attempting to unify it).

    The idea is that when an output is created it assigns a clock to itself
    according to its sources' clocks. Eventually, all remaining unknown clocks
    are forced to clock.

(** {1 Clock variables}
    Used to infer what clock a source belongs to.
    Each variable comes with
      - a list of active sources belonging to the clock, unused during
        inference/unification, but animated by the clock when running
      - a list of sub-clocks, used during unification's occurs-check
        to avoid cycles which would result in unsound behavior
        e.g. add([s,cross(f,s)]).
    Clock constants are objects of type [proto_clock], but need to also
    maintain the information attached to variables.

    The unification algorithm can be described as follows, ignoring
    the active source maintenance.
    X[Y1,Y2,..,Yn] denotes a variable or constant clock with the set Gamma
       of subclocks,
       from a first-order unification perspective it should be thought of
       as a term X(Y1,Y2,..,Yn,...) where the second ... denotes a
       row variable: we don't know if there are more parameters there
       (more subclocks)
    We write X[Gamma] with Gamma list of clocks, and X[..Y..] when
    Y belongs to the subclocks of X, or the subclocks of the subclocks,
    etc.
    Unification rules are:
      X[..Y..] = Y[..]    ---> ERROR (occurs-check)
      c1[...]  = c2[...]  ---> ERROR (rigid-rigid)
      X[Gamma] = Y[Delta] ---> X,Y:=Z[Gamma,Delta]
         Here Gamma,Delta denotes an union. It is possible that two
         distinct variables might become unified, in which case we'll
         end up with two occurrences of the same subclock.

    (** Startup/shutdown.

      Get the source ready for streaming on demand, have it release resources
      when it's not used any more, and decide whether the source should run in
      caching mode.

      A source may be accessed by several sources, and must switch to caching
      mode when it may be accessed by more than one source, in order to ensure
      consistency of the delivered stream chunk.

      Before that a source P accesses another source S it must activate it. The
      activation can be static, or dynamic. A static activation means that
      P may pull data from S at any time. A dynamic activation means that P
      won't use S directly but may at some point build a source which will
      access S. This dynamic creation may occur in the middle of an output
      round, which is why S needs to know in advance, since in some cases it
      might have to enter caching mode from the beginning of the round in case
      the dynamic activation occurs.

      An activation is identified by the path to the source which required it.
      It is possible that two identical activations are done, and they should
      not be treated as a single one.

      In short, a source can avoid caching when: it has only one static
      activation and all its dynamic activations are sub-paths of the static
      one. When there is no static activation, there cannot be any access.

      It is assumed that all streaming is done in one thread for a given clock,
      so the activation management API is not thread-safe. *)

         - B finishes its track, becomes unavailable
         - A starts streaming again, needs to receive an EOT before
           having to worry about availability.

           Another important example is crossfade, if e.g. a transition
           returns a failling source.

         So we add special cases where, instead of calling #get_frame, we
         call silent_end_track to properly end a track by inserting a break.

         This makes the whole protocol a bit sloppy as it weakens constraints
         tying #is_ready and #get, preventing the detection of "bad" calls
         of #get without prior check of #is_ready.

         This fix makes it really important to keep #is_ready = true during a
