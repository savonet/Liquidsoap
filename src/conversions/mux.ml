(** Muxing takes a master and an auxiliary source.
  * The auxiliary source streams only one kind of content,
  * the master has no channel of that kind, anything for the others.
  *
  * There are several possible modes for muxing:
  *  - Master: the auxiliary source should be infallible, and has to
  *    fill in exactly the data zone that the master produces.
  *    Track information for the aux source is lost.
  *    In the future we might want to require exclusivity on the auxiliary
  *    source because this mode requires doing tricks to it, and sharing
  *    would have funny effects.
  *  - Auxiliary: same with exchanged roles.
  *  - None: The sources have a symmetric role, we loose all track
  *    information, filling as much as possible. If one of the sources
  *    is not ready anymore, extra data from the other is dropped.
  *  - Both: We get tracks from both sources.
