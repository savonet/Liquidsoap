(**
    Michael-Scott classic multi-producer multi-consumer queue.

   All functions are lockfree. It is the recommended starting point
   when needing FIFO structure. It is inspired by {{:
   https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf}
   Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent
   Queue Algorithms}.

(** The type of lock-free queue. *)
type 'a t

(** [create ()] returns a new queue, initially empty. *)
val create : unit -> 'a t

(** [is_empty q] returns empty if [q] is empty. *)
val is_empty : 'a t -> bool

(** [push q v] adds the element [v] at the end of the queue [q]. *)
val push : 'a t -> 'a -> unit

(** Raised when {!pop} or {!peek} is applied to an empty queue. *)
exception Empty

(** [pop q] removes and returns the first element in queue [q].

    @raise Empty if [q] is empty. *)
val pop : 'a t -> 'a

(** [pop_opt q] removes and returns the first element in queue [q], or
    returns [None] if the queue is empty. *)
val pop_opt : 'a t -> 'a option

(** [peek q] returns the first element in queue [q].

    @raise Empty if [q] is empty. *)
val peek : 'a t -> 'a

(** [peek_opt q] returns the first element in queue [q], or
    returns [None] if the queue is empty. *)
val peek_opt : 'a t -> 'a option

(** The type of cursor. *)
type 'a cursor

(** Obtain a snapshot of the queue. This is a constant time operation. *)
val snapshot : 'a t -> 'a cursor

(** [next c] returns [Some (e, c')] where [e] is the head of the queue and
    [c'] is the tail, if the queue is non-empty. Otherwise, returns [None]. *)
val next : 'a cursor -> ('a * 'a cursor) option
