(** {1 Type generalization and instantiation}
  *
  * We don't have type schemes per se, but we compute generalizable variables
  * and keep track of them in the AST.
  * This is simple and useful because in any case we need to distinguish
  * two 'a variables bound at different places. Indeed, we might instantiate
  * one in a term where the second is bound, and we don't want to
  * merge the two when going under the binder.
  *
  * When generalizing we need to know what can be generalized in the outermost
  * type but also in the inner types of the term forming a let-definition.
  * Indeed those variables will have to be instantiated by fresh ones for
  * every instance.
  *
  * If the value restriction applies, then we have some (fun (...) -> ...)
  * and any type variable of higher level can be generalized, whether it's
  * in the outermost type or not. *)

(** Return a list of generalizable variables in a type.
  * This is performed after type inference on the left-hand side
  * of a let-in, with [level] being the level of that let-in.
  * Uses the simple method of ML, to be associated with a value restriction. *)
