(** A clock represents the rate at which a source runs. In itself it does not
  * do much, except forcing that one source belongs to exactly one clock,
  * which prevents inconsistent uses of the source. Clocks are assigned to
  * sources at the end of the typing phase. *)

(** In [`CPU] mode, synchronization is governed by the CPU clock.
  * In [`None] mode, there is no synchronization control. Latency in
  * is governed by the time it takes for the sources to produce and
  * output data.
  * In [`Auto] mode, synchronization is governed by the CPU unless at
  * least one active source is declared [self_sync] in which case latency
  * is delegated to this source. A typical example being a source linked
  * to a sound card, in which case the source latency is governed
  * by the sound card's clock. Another case is synchronous network
  * protocol such as [input.srt]. *)

(** Indicates whether the application has started to run or not. *)
val running : unit -> bool

(** {2 Global clock management} *)

(** When created, sources have a clock variable, which gets unified
  * with other variables or concrete clocks. When the time comes to
  * initialize the source, if its clock isn't defined yet, it gets
  * assigned to a default clock and that clock will take care of
  * starting it.
  *
  * Taking all freshly created sources, assigning them to the default
  * clock if needed, and starting them, is performed by [collect].
  * This is typically called after each script execution.
  * Technically we could separate collection and clock assignment,
  * which might simplify some things if it becomes unmanageable in the
  * future.
  *
  * Sometimes we need to be sure that collect doesn't happen during
  * the execution of a function. Otherwise, sources might be assigned
  * the default clock too early. This is done using [collect_after].
  * This need is not cause by running collect in too many places, but
  * simply because there is no way to control collection on a per-thread
  * basis (collect only the sources created by a given thread of
  * script execution).
  *
  * Functions running using [collect_after] should be kept short.
  * However, in theory, with multiple threads, we could have plenty
  * of short functions always overlapping so that collection can
  * never be done. This shouldn't happen too much, but in any case
  * we can't get rid of this without a more fine-grained collect,
  * which would require (heavy) execution contexts to tell from
  * which thread/code a given source has been added. *)
